# Large Language Models (LLMs)

Welcome to the **Large Language Models (LLMs)** project! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding, building, and fine-tuning large language models using state-of-the-art techniques.

## Overview

Large Language Models are advanced AI systems trained on extensive text data to understand and generate human-like language. They are pivotal in various natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and more.

This project provides:

- **Educational Content**: Detailed explanations of LLM architectures, training processes, and operational guidelines.
- **Practical Implementations**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the construction and fine-tuning of LLMs.
- **Assignments**: Self-paced exercises to reinforce understanding and practical skills.
